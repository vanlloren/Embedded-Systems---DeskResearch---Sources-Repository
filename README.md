# Embedded Systems - Desk Research Sources Repository

## Overview

This repository serves as a centralized collection of valuable sources, research materials, and documentation used to analyze Kubernetes and its deployment in the Computing Continuum. The goal is to maintain an organized library of information for embedded systems research, making it easy to locate and reference relevant materials.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders based on content type:

```
.
├── pdfs/              # PDF documents and academic papers
├── whitepapers/       # Technical whitepapers and industry reports
├── presentations/     # Slide decks, conference presentations, and talks
├── code-examples/     # Code samples, scripts, and implementation examples
└── README.md          # This file
```

### Folder Descriptions

- **`pdfs/`**: Contains PDF documents including academic papers, research articles, technical documentation, and other reference materials in PDF format.

- **`whitepapers/`**: Houses technical whitepapers, industry reports, and detailed technical documents that provide in-depth analysis and specifications.

- **`presentations/`**: Stores presentation materials such as PowerPoint slides, Keynote presentations, PDFs of talks, and other visual materials from conferences and workshops.

- **`code-examples/`**: Contains practical code examples, sample implementations, scripts, configuration files, and proof-of-concept code related to Kubernetes and embedded systems deployment.

## Navigation Instructions
